controls:
WASD/Left Stick(Controller) to move
Left shift/ B button(controller) to roll/ sprint
E key/ X button to melee
Space/ A button to jump
Escape/Start button to pause
Left mouse button/ right trigger to cast spell
Right arrow key/ D pad right to switch spell
F key to focus on enemy


problems with build:
when you press the focus button with a controller it didnt work so to focus you have to be on keyboard to use that function
the enemies still make a spin when locked onto the player

What is needed to be shown:
There is currently 3 useable spells: 1 healing, 1 Aoe, and 1 Thrown spell.
all effects of the spell do work as intended

Current state of the build:
There is 1 level with enemies that follow the player and the player has the abilities to fight them off
but so do the enemies
